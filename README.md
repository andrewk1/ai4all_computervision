## Stanford AI4ALL Computer Vision Track 
This repository includes the PDF slides and LaTeX source for the Computer Vision track at Stanford's 2019 AI4ALL camp. The curriculum aims to introduce mathematical concepts alongside vision intuitions, beginning with linear regression and vector spaces and ending with deep convolutional neural networks. It assumes no prior understanding apart from having seen multivariable linear equations, but some basic understanding of calculus can be helpful. The entire slide deck covers around 4-6 hours of material, depending on the amount of time to group discussion and questions.

This material borrows from Stanford's [CS231N](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course. It is notably modified with introductory slides for relevant concepts, a heavier reliance on visual intuition, and more student interaction.
